# Beltex Combinations

I wrote this code as I was playing [Beltex](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2051420/Beltex/) in order to find the right combinations to get to a number.

## Problem

The problem was to get to a number from a limited set of a numbers and some operations.

The available operations are addition, substraction and multiplication.

For example, if your base set of a number is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, if you want to get to `26` in the least amount of steps, you can do :
- 1 + 5 * 5
- 2 + 4 * 6
- 5 * 6 - 4
- 6 + 4 * 5
